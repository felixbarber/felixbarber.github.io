# Blog

Come back here when I write something new! I promise it won't be *too* long... In the meantime, here are the links to a few general interest articles from my days back at the Harvard based, student-run blog [Science In The News](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/):

- [Is it Smoky in Here? The importance of the Clean Air Act in the 21st century](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2019/smokey-importance-clean-air-act-21st-century/)
- [The Future of Energy Storage: A lost opportunity for the U.S.?](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/future-energy-storage-lost-opportunity-u-s/)
