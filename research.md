# Research

Widespread antibiotic resistance is increasingly undermining the efficacy of our most successful antibiotics. 
Creative and interdisciplinary approaches are required to address this existential threat. 
The Gram-positive bacterial cell wall is a rigid structure made of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids that sustains the immense hydrostatic pressure within the cell, 
thereby preventing cell lysis. Our best antibiotics target the synthesis of peptidoglycan.  
In an exciting development, recent research demonstrated that additionally inhibiting teichoic acid synthesis can reduce resistance to these frontline drugs. 
Despite this, our understanding of how teichoic acids influence bacterial cell growth is very poor. My goal is to determine the mechanisms by which teichoic acids 
impact the cellular growth rate.  Based on my novel preliminary data, my central hypothesis is that teichoic acids serve a critical and overlooked role in governing 
cell growth by simultaneously controlling peptidoglycan synthesis and cell wall stiffness, potentially offering a novel avenue to counteract antibiotic resistance.  
I am currently constructing genetic tools to precisely tune teichoic acid synthesis, abundance and biochemistry. I will then combine these tools with novel 
microfluidics-based assays to measure bacterial cell wall growth, peptidoglycan synthesis and cell wall stiffness to test my central hypothesis in the Gram-positive bacterium, 
*Bacillus subtilis*.
